Exception handling in Java is managed through five keywords: try, catch, finally, throw, and throws.

Checked Exceptions: These are exceptions that are checked at compile-time. The compiler ensures they are either caught or declared in the method signature using the throws keyword. Examples include IOException and SQLException.

Unchecked Exceptions: These are exceptions that are not checked at compile-time. They occur at runtime and are subclasses of RuntimeException. Examples include NullPointerException and ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.

Error: These are serious problems that are not meant to be caught by applications. Examples include OutOfMemoryError and StackOverflowError.

Best practices include catching specific exceptions rather than general ones, logging exceptions appropriately, and using try-with-resources for automatic resource management.
