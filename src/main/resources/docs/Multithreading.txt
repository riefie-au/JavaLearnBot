Multithreading in Java allows concurrent execution of two or more parts of a program for maximum utilization of CPU.

Thread Creation: There are two main ways to create threads in Java:
1. Extending the Thread class
2. Implementing the Runnable interface

Thread States: A thread can be in one of these states: NEW, RUNNABLE, BLOCKED, WAITING, TIMED_WAITING, or TERMINATED.

Synchronization: When multiple threads access shared resources, synchronization is needed to prevent thread interference. This can be achieved using synchronized methods or synchronized blocks.

Thread Pools: The Executor framework provides thread pool management through ExecutorService, which manages a pool of worker threads and handles thread lifecycle.

Common issues in multithreading include deadlock, race conditions, and thread starvation.
