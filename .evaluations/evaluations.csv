"2025-12-21T03:03:45.6335809","what is java","Java is an object-oriented programming language developed by Sun Microsystems. It is platform-independent at both the source and binary levels, thanks to the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Java is extensively used for building large-scale enterprise applications, Android apps, and web servers. Its strong typing, automatic memory management, and comprehensive API contribute to its stability and scalability [1][3].","10","Correct"

It is implemented using the keyword `extends`. This allows subclasses to inherit attributes and methods from their superclass, enabling code reusability and modularity. Subclasses can also add new properties and methods specific to themselves and override methods from the superclass to provide specialized behavior [2][3].

In programming, inheritance can be categorized into several types:

1. **Single Inheritance**: A subclass inherits from one superclass.
   ```java
   class Car extends Vehicle {}
   ```

2. **Multilevel Inheritance**: A chain of inheritance where a subclass inherits from another subclass.
   ```java
   class ElectricCar extends Car {}
   ```

3. **Hierarchical Inheritance**: Multiple subclasses inherit from the same superclass.
   ```java
   class Bike extends Vehicle {}
   class Truck extends Vehicle {}
   ```

4. **Multiple Inheritance (via interfaces)**: Achieved through interfaces, since Java does not support multiple class inheritance.
   ```java
   interface Electric {}
   class ElectricCar extends Car implements Electric {}
   ``` 

These types of inheritance allow for various ways to structure classes and share functionality in object-oriented programming [1][2].","10","Correct"
