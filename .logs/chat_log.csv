It is implemented using the keyword `extends`. This allows subclasses to inherit attributes and methods from their superclass, enabling code reusability and modularity. Subclasses can also add new properties and methods specific to themselves and override methods from the superclass to provide specialized behavior [2][3].

In programming, inheritance can be categorized into several types:

1. **Single Inheritance**: A subclass inherits from one superclass.

   ```

2. **Multilevel Inheritance**: A chain of inheritance where a subclass inherits from another subclass.

3. **Hierarchical Inheritance**: Multiple subclasses inherit from the same superclass.
   ```java

4. **Multiple Inheritance (via interfaces)**: Achieved through interfaces, since Java does not support multiple class inheritance.

Inheritance is the mechanism by which a subclass acquires the properties and behaviors of its superclass. It is implemented using the keyword extends in Java.

Example:

Car myCar = new Car();
myCar.brand = ""Toyota"";
myCar.wheels = 4;
myCar.doors = 4;
myCar.start(); // Calls overridden start method in Car
myCar.honk();  // Calls method defined in Car
myCar.stop();  // Calls method inherited from Vehicle


In this example, the Car object has access to attributes and methods from Vehicle, demonstrating the benefits of inheritance.

A subclass (also called a child class or derived class) is a class that inherits attributes and methods from a superclass. Subclasses can:

Inherit properties and methods of the superclass.

Add new properties and methods specific to themselves.

Override superclass methods to provide specialized behavior.

Subclasses allow specialization of general concepts represented by superclasses.

Example:

public class Car extends Vehicle { // Subclass
    int doors;

    public void honk() {
        System.out.println(""Car honk!"");
    }

protected: Accessible in subclass and package.

public: Accessible everywhere.

Example:

class Vehicle {
    private int engineNumber;
    protected String brand;
    public int wheels;
}

class Car extends Vehicle {
    public void display() {
        // engineNumber is not accessible

It enables developers to write flexible, reusable, and maintainable code by allowing objects of different types to be treated uniformly while each can define its own behavior. This is achieved primarily through method overriding, inheritance, and interfaces, and is closely associated with dynamic method dispatch, which determines which method implementation is executed at runtime [1][3].

There are two main types of polymorphism in Java:

1. **Compile-Time Polymorphism (Static Polymorphism)**: This is achieved through method overloading, where multiple methods can have the same name but different parameters.

2. **Runtime Polymorphism (Dynamic Polymorphism)**: This occurs through method overriding, where a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass [2].

Polymorphism enhances code flexibility and reusability by allowing common behavior to be defined in a superclass or interface, which can then be reused by multiple subclasses. This reduces code duplication and improves maintainability [3]. 

In real-world applications, polymorphism can be seen in scenarios such as a superclass `Animal` with a method `makeSound()`, where subclasses like `Dog` and `Cat` provide their own implementations of `makeSound()`. Even though all objects are treated as `Animal`, their behavior differs based on the actual object type [2].

Chunk: Polymorphism in Java: A Comprehensive Explanation
1. Introduction to Polymorphism

Polymorphism is one of the four fundamental principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), alongside encapsulation, inheritance, and abstraction. The term “polymorphism” originates from the Greek words poly (many) and morph (forms), meaning “many forms.” In the context of Java programming, polymorphism refers to the ability of a single interface, method, or reference to represent different underlying forms of behavior.

Polymorphism allows developers to write flexible, reusable, and maintainable code. Instead of tightly coupling logic to specific classes, programmers can work with generalized types and allow the Java runtime to determine the appropriate behavior at execution time. This design approach

In object-oriented programming, polymorphism works together with other OOP principles:

Encapsulation hides internal implementation details.

Inheritance allows classes to inherit behavior from other classes.

Abstraction defines what an object does, not how it does it.

Polymorphism allows objects of different types to be treated uniformly.

For example, consider a superclass Animal with a method makeSound(). Subclasses like Dog and Cat may provide their own implementations of makeSound(). Even though all objects are treated as Animal, their behavior differs depending on the actual object type.
