It is implemented using the keyword `extends`. This allows the subclass to inherit attributes and methods from the superclass, enabling code reuse and establishing a hierarchical relationship between classes. For example, if you have a class `Vehicle`, a subclass `Car` can inherit from it as follows:

```java
class Car extends Vehicle {}
```

In this case, the `Car` class inherits all the accessible attributes and methods from the `Vehicle` class, allowing for a structured and organized codebase [2]. 

Inheritance plays a crucial role in object-oriented programming by promoting code reuse, enhancing maintainability, and allowing for polymorphism, where a subclass can override methods to provide specific behavior [4]. 

Overall, inheritance facilitates the creation of a more modular and understandable code structure in Java applications.","- What role does inheritance play in object-oriented programming in Java?

Multilevel Inheritance: A chain of inheritance where a subclass inherits from another subclass.

Hierarchical Inheritance: Multiple subclasses inherit from the same superclass.

4. Inheritance: Connecting Superclass and Subclass

Inheritance is the mechanism by which a subclass acquires the properties and behaviors of its superclass. It is implemented using the keyword extends in Java.

Example:

Car myCar = new Car();
myCar.brand = ""Toyota"";
myCar.wheels = 4;
myCar.doors = 4;
myCar.start(); // Calls overridden start method in Car
myCar.honk();  // Calls method defined in Car
myCar.stop();  // Calls method inherited from Vehicle

class Car extends Vehicle {

Subclasses can override methods from their superclass to provide specific behavior. Method overriding ensures that when a method is called on a subclass object, the subclass’s version is executed.

Rules for overriding:

The method must have the same name, return type, and parameters.

The access level of the overridden method cannot be more restrictive.

Subclasses can use the @Override annotation for clarity.

Example:

class Bike extends Vehicle {
    @Override
